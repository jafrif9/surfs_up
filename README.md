# Surf's Up

## Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to help W.Avy determine whether a surf and ice cream shop business would be appropriate for Oahu's temperature year round. In order to determine this, temperature comparison between the summer and winter months, specifically June and December, were completed.

## Results
**June Statistics for Temperature in Oahu**

**December Statistics for Temperature in Oahu**

The following were seen from the results of the analysis shown above:

1. The mean temperature of 75°F in June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F in December.
2. Oahu has a larger temperature range in December than in June. In December, the temperature fluctuates within a 27° range, ranging from 56°F to 83°F. In June, the temperature has a 21° range, with temperatures ranging from 64°F to 85°F.
3. The temperature data for June has a higher 50th percentile and 75th percentile, while the temperature data for December has a higher 25th percentile.

## Summary
Overall, the temperature data for both December and June are not drastically different from one another. Therefore, opening a surf and ice cream shop year-round would prove to be a successful source of income. Additionally, I would perform a query to determine the pattern regarding levels of precipitation year-round and the frequency of potential heatwaves. Both queries would aid in determining days in which sales may exceed expectation or struggle to meet internal goals.
